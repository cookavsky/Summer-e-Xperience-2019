## Getting Started
Api allows you to search for any album contained in the Spotify API. Provide detailed data and, if it is possible to listen to data samples. For the application to work you need to edit the file http.service.ts and enter the active access_token. I tried in all ways to do a login system to automatically save access_token, I did not want to use a ready solution. Unfortunately, I did not make out.

## Technologies
* [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.2.3.

## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development:
* You can search any album by album name
* The following album information is displayed on the album list:
- the photo of the album or placeholder
- album name
- the artist
- the date
- the number of songs in the album
* You can sort the list of albums after the release date or alphabetically after the album name
* You can see the details of the selected album:
- the duration of the entire album
- popularity
- a list of songs in the album with duration
- listen to the sample if it is available

To-do list:
* System login to Api

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Status
No longer continue, because i do not have time for this.
